# How to run the app

The first thing you will have to do is pull the repo code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/julieta-foglia/ank-challenge.git
```

After you have downloaded the code, cd to the project folder:

```
cd ank-challenge
```

(In case you have downloaded the repo in a different folder, just replace `ank-challenge` with the name of the folder you have used).

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And finally run the project on ios or android:

```
yarn ios
```

or

```
yarn android
```
